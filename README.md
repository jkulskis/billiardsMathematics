This project is being made for mathematically modeling billiards, specifically the closed/open loops that a ball's trajectory may follow on a frictionless pool table that conserves energy. The main purpose of this project is to create visuals for a reader on the topic to better see how billiards mathematics works.

There are two modes:

pacman mode : When the ball hits a boundary, it does a "pacman reflection," meaning it reapppears across the height if it hits a ceiling/floor, or across the width if it hits one of the walls 

normal mode : The ball bounces according to the law of optics, with angles being preserved. This is the expected behavior for energy conserving billiards.

The .pde file is a processing sketch which can be compiled, edited, and executed with the processing IDE
